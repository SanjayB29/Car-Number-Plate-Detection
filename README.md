# Number Plate Detection Project

## Description

This project focuses on detecting number plates from car images using computer vision and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques. It leverages libraries such as OpenCV for image processing, EasyOCR for text extraction, and additional utilities for image manipulation and enhancement.

## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanjayB29/Car-Number-Plate-Detection.git
cd Car-Number-Plate-Detection
```

2. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The main script of the project is `NumberPlateDetection.ipynb`, which can be executed in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment. This notebook includes detailed instructions and code blocks for detecting number plates in images.

To start the notebook, use:
```bash
jupyter notebook NumberPlateDetection.ipynb
```
